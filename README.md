# Technologies Used and Justifications

- NumPy: Efficient numerical operations, essential for handling image arrays.

OpenCV (cv2): For reading, resizing, and preprocessing video frames.

ImageIO & Scikit-Image: To load and transform image data seamlessly.

TensorFlow & Keras: The primary deep learning framework for model building, offering flexibility and GPU support.

Matplotlib: Visualizing data and model performance.

GRU & LSTM: RNN architectures for capturing temporal dependencies in video sequences.

Conv2D & Conv3D: To extract spatial features from individual frames and across temporal dimensions.

Model Callbacks (EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau): For training optimization and preventing overfitting.

3. Detailed Process and Logic Explanation

Data Preprocessing:

Frame Extraction: Extract 30 frames per video.

Resizing & Normalization: Standardizes frame size and scales pixel values between 0 and 1 to improve model performance.

Batch Generator: Handles real-time data feeding during model training, reducing memory load.

Model Architecture:

Convolutional Layers (Conv2D/Conv3D):

Extract spatial features from frames.

Apply filters to detect edges, patterns, and motion.

TimeDistributed Layer:

Applies the same convolutional operations to each frame independently, preserving temporal structure.

Recurrent Layers (GRU/LSTM):

Capture temporal dependencies across video frames.

LSTM excels in learning long-term dependencies, while GRU offers faster training with comparable performance.

Dense Layers:

Perform final classification based on learned features.

Dropout & Batch Normalization:

Reduce overfitting and stabilize learning.

Training Strategy:

Model Checkpoints: Save the best model based on validation accuracy.

Early Stopping: Halt training when performance plateaus.

ReduceLROnPlateau: Adjust learning rate dynamically to improve convergence.****
